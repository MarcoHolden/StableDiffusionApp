# StableDiffusionApp

## Stable Bud Image Generation App

Stable Bud is a simple GUI application built with Tkinter for generating images using the Stable Diffusion model. The application allows users to input a prompt and trigger the generation of an image using the pre-trained model. This code was largely made following Nicholas Renotte's design but I made changes to make it work with my given device.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

- Python
